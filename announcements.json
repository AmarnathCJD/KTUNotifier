    "description": "The rapid growth in Internet connectivity, mobile computing, IoT, cyber-physical systems, etc. profoundly impacts applications such as e-governance, connected healthcare, financial systems and tactical networks. Persistent attacks on such complex networked systems continue to expose their vulnerabilities. Advanced persistent threats (APT), social engineering attacks, and denial of service attacks exploit software, hardware, socio-cultural, and policy weaknesses. Therefore the design, analysis, development and deployment of trusted systems continue to pose major challenges to the technical, policy and consumer communities. This collaborative workshop between APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) and the Stevens Institute of Technology will identify the key R&amp;D, innovation/entrepreneurship, education and training challenges/opportunities presented by current and next generation trusted systems. The workshop program includes keynote talks by high profile thought leaders and interdisciplinary discussions involving government/ industry/academic researchers. Technical presentations will cover state-of-the art innovations in trusted systems and significant gaps. The outcome of this workshop will be a strong working relationship between researchers at KTU and Stevens. It will also forge new larger collaboration opportunities between U.S. and India in the area of research and innovation in trusted systems.<!-- &lt;/a&gt; -->"
